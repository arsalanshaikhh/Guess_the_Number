# Guess_the_Number

A guess the number is a simple guessing game where a user is supposed to guess a number from 0 to 100 in a maximum of 10 attempts for easy mode and 5 attempts for gard mode and The game will end after 10 attempts and if the player failed to guess the number, and then he loses the game.

This is the project i have done personally apart from Masai School.


## Features:

1.if the guessed number is less than the correct one it shows the hint that the number low and vice versa. 2.it also stores the number of attempts and value of attempts. 3.I also added SFX sound to the notification. 4.it also shows the specific massage with emoji at the time of win or loss.
